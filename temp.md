❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or receive any parameters, implying that it relies on variables `a` and `b`
being available in the scope where the function is defined.
* ❌ The function lacks clarity about where `a` and `b` are defined or how they receive their values, leading to
potential runtime errors if `a` and `b` are not defined when the function is called.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now explicitly declares `a` and `b` as parameters, making it clear that these values should be provided
when the function is called.
* ✔ Resolves the ambiguity about where `a` and `b` come from, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving the
function's reusability and understandability.
